# Doman Mahjong Status

I'd like to make a plugin that logs mahjong game info/stats.

This branch just logs some stats when you use the `/mjstat` chat command.

Example output:
```
Reading UIState...
read [1E, 00, 96, 05, 9A, 06, 3C, 00, 09, 01] from UIState+0x14F78
Matches Played: 30
Current Rating: 1430
Highest Rating: 1690
Rank: 1 Kyu (0x09) - 60 points
Unknown: 0x01
```
